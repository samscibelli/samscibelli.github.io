# ASTR 5340: Introduction to Radio Astronomy

Astronomy 5340 is a one-semester UVa course in radio astronomy intended for astronomy graduate
students, astrochemistry graduate students, and advanced undergraduates with a strong
background in physics. It centers around the text, "Essential Radio Astronomy" by James J. Condon and Scott M. Ransom (content is available [online](https://science.nrao.edu/opportunities/courses/era)). The Fall 2024 class was co-taught by myself, Samantha Scibelli, and Jim Braatz.

# AAA.org Course: Introduction to Astrochemistry

Taught in the spring of 2024, this undergraduate level [course](https://aaa.org/event/introduction-to-astrochemistry-2024/2024-05-28/) focused on introducing the basics of molecular spectroscopy and the observational aspects of astrochemistry. 

# Independent Study 599: Science 'in' Fiction

This course was designed for credit towards the University of Arizona's Graduate Certificate in Science Communication. As a scientist interested in the ways in which science can be communicated to a wide range of audiences, Samantha Scibelli wanted to design a course, with the help of Professor Alison Deming, that specifically explored how creative fiction can convey scientific concepts.
