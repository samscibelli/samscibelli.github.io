Hi there! I'm Samantha Scibelli, a graduate student and NSF Fellow in the Department of Astronomy at [Steward Observatory at the University of Arizona ](https://www.as.arizona.edu/). My thesis is focused on constraining the physical, kinematics, and chemical structure and evolution of low-mass prestellar cores.

Current Research Interests
======
***COMs in Prestellar Cores***

I am interested in the broader topics of star formation, astrochemistry and radio astronomy. In particular, I have been studying cold clumps of dust, known as starless and gravitationally bound prestellar cores, located along filamentary star forming regions such as the Taurus Molecular Cloud (shown below). I use the 12M radio dish on Kitt Peak, searching for Complex Organic Molecules (COMs), which are of interest to astrochemists and astrobiologists studying the origins of life, within these prestellar cores. I want to understand how chemistry can help us understand the physical properties and evolutionary timescales of these prestellar cores.

Previous Research Interests
======
***Dark Matter and Gravitational Lensing***

As an undergraduate physics student at Stony Brook University, I was interested in dark matter and gravitational lensing. 

Additionally, the summer before I started my undergraduate program, I interned at the Laser Teaching Center in the basement of the physics building at Stony Brook. I worked on understanding the caustic patterns that arise from evaporating water droplets. [See my old research page here.](https://laser.physics.sunysb.edu/_samantha/index.html)
