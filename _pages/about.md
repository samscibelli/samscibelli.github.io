About Me
======

Hi there! I'm Samantha Scibelli, a graduate student and NSF Graduate Research Fellow in the Department of Astronomy and [Steward Observatory](https://www.as.arizona.edu/) at the University of Arizona. I am interested in the broader topics of star formation, astrochemistry and radio astronomy. Currently, I am focused on constraining the physical, kinematic, and chemical structure of low-mass prestellar cores to better understand their evolution. See [Current Research Interests](#current_research_interests).

In my free time I enjoy cuddling with my cat, Tabatha, going for hikes in the Tucson Mountains, cooking new recipes and reading popular science books. Passionate about science writing myself, I am pursuing a Science Communications Certificate at the University of Arizona. [A short memoir](https://www.terrain.org/2020/science-stories/a-witch-to-the-stars/), describing my early childhood and how I got interested in astronomy, has been published online at [terrian.org](https://www.terrain.org/). I have also been featured in the [1MWIS campaign](http://www.1mwis.com/profiles/samantha-scibelli), which aims to collect profiles of 1 million STEM women to provide visible role models and inspiration the next generation of girls.

***COMs in Prestellar Cores***

Astrobiologists are interested in understanding the origins of organic chemistry, the basis for life on Earth, and believe it is very likely to have had its origin at the very early stages of solar system formation. A starless, or prestellar, core is a dense clump of gas and dust which acts as a primordial birthplace for a low-mass (solar-type) star. I use the [ARO](http://aro.as.arizona.edu/) 12M radio dish on Kitt Peak to search for Complex Organic Molecules (COMs) in prestellar cores located along the Taurus Molecular Cloud, a filamentary star forming region (shown below). By studying the chemistry within these cores we can better understand their physical properties and evolutionary timescales.

Previous Research Interests

***V Hydrae, an AGB star in Transition***

As an intern at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, I worked on analyzing Hubble Data of the carbon star V Hydrae (V Hya). This unique object provides insight into the nature of the launching mechanism of jet-like outflows that are believed to be the cause of the poorly understood transition phase of AGB stars into aspherical planetary nebulae.

***Dark Matter and Gravitational Lensing***

As an undergraduate physics student at Stony Brook University, I was interested in dark matter and gravitational lensing.  My project focused on trying to break the degeneracies between disc and halo contributions in spiral galaxy rotation curves by combining kinematics and lensing. [[ADS](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/#abs/2018arXiv181106556S/abstract),[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.06556)]

Additionally, the summer before I started my undergraduate program, I interned at the Laser Teaching Center in the basement of the physics building at Stony Brook. I worked on understanding the caustic patterns that arise from evaporating water droplets, with the foresight in mind that understanding caustics would help me to formulate a project on gravitional lensing.
