Hi there! I'm Samantha Scibelli, a graduate and NSF Fellow in the Department of Astronomy at [Steward Observatory at the University of Arizona ](https://www.as.arizona.edu/).

Current Research Interests
======
My research interests focus on star formation and on the cold clumps of gas and dust stars form in, known as starless/prestellar cores, along filamentary star forming regions. Specifically I want to understand on how chemistry can help us understand the physcial properties and evolutionary timescales of the prestellar cores.

Previous Research Interests
======
As an undergraduate physics student at Stony Brook University, I was interested in dark matter and gravitational lensing.
