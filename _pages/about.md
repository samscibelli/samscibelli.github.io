Hi there! I'm Samantha Scibelli, a graduate student and NSF Fellow in the Department of Astronomy at [Steward Observatory at the University of Arizona ](https://www.as.arizona.edu/).

Current Research Interests
======
***COMs in Prestellar Cores***

I am interested in the broader topics of star formation, astrochemistry and radio astronomy. In particular, I observed cold clumps of dust, known as starless and gravitationally bound prestellar cores, along filamentary star forming regions such as the Taurus Molecular Cloud (shown below). I use the 12M radio dish on Kitt Peak, searching for Complex Organic Molecules (COMs) that are of interest to astrochemists and astrobiologists studying the origins of life. I want to understand how chemistry can help us understand the physical properties and evolutionary timescales of these prestellar cores.

Previous Research Interests
======
As an undergraduate physics student at Stony Brook University, I was interested in dark matter and gravitational lensing.
