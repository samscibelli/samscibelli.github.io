<p>
The Diversity Journal Club is a space created to engage with the Steward Observatory community at all levels on topics of equity,
inclusion, and diversity. As an organizer, I listen to the needs of our community and help lead discussions which will enact
meaningful changes to make Steward a more welcoming and inclusive community.

<p>
Astronomy Camp seeks to motivate all students to further their education in science, math, engineering, 
and technical fields. I was a camper when I was 16 and the 
experience motivated me to continue pursuing astronomy as a career. Now I am a counselor and hope to be that inspiration for the
next generation of scientists and great thinkers!

<p>
The NOAO Teen Astronomy Cafe is an out-of-school program for high school students that provides them the opportunity
to interact with astronomers working on cutting-edge science. Students participate in hands on demonstrations, work
on interative computer activities and listen to presentations from the scientists at NOAO and other institutions.
The students also have the opportunity to ask the speaker and volunteers questions, learning what a day in the life 
of an astronomer is all about!
