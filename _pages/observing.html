Astronomy Camp seeks to motivate all students to further their education in science, math, engineering, 
and technical fields. I was a camper when I was 16 and the 
experience motivated me to continue pursuing astronomy as a career. Now I am a counselor and hope to be that inspiration for the
next generation of scientists and great thinkers!
