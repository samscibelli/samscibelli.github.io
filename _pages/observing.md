[**GBT Observations**](https://greenbankobservatory.org/science/gbt-surveys/)

*Project GLUCOSE:* The GBT L1544 Unbiased Complex Organics SurvEy! This spectral line survey will cover Q-band, from ~38-48 GHz. [Check out our survey page!](https://greenbankobservatory.org/science/gbt-surveys/glucose/)

*GBT ARGUS*

Remote GBT Observing during 2020 and 2021 of the B10 region in the Taurus Molecular Cloud. We are mapping in C18O and 13CO at high (6.8'') resolution with the 3mm ARGUS instrument!

[**IRAM 30m Observations**](https://www.iram-institute.org/EN/30-meter-telescope.php)


Date: 10/7/19 - 10/15/19


Observing at the IRAM 30m telescope in Pico Veleta, Spain!

[**SOFIA Observations**](https://www.sofia.usra.edu/)

Date: 9/28/18 

Observing on SOFIA tonight with polarization instrument HAWC+! We are looking at massive cold gas clumps to study the orientation of the magnetic field to see if it traces the gas outflows, with the goal of learning how massive stars are formed! How cool - a 2.5 telescope on an airplane!

[**MMT Observations**](https://www.mmto.org/)

Date: 2/5/18

Observing at the MMT, a 6.5 meter optical telescope, tonight! We will be looking at a dying star (V Hydrae) which ejects gaseous bullets so fast it would only take them 30min to travel from Earth to the moon!

[**ARO 12m Observations**](http://aro.as.arizona.edu/)

Date: 10/29/17

The first of many nights observing with the 12m on Kitt Peak! We found some complex organic molecules (one of which is the cause of hangovers) in prestellar cores!
