[**GBT Observations**](https://greenbankobservatory.org/science/gbt-surveys/)

*Project GLUCOSE:* The GBT L1544 Unbiased Complex Organics SurvEy! This spectral line survey will cover Q-band, from ~38-48 GHz. [Check out our survey page!](https://greenbankobservatory.org/science/gbt-surveys/glucose/)

Date: 9/18/22 - 9/23/22

I was able to visit Green Bank, West Virginia for a conference and toured the 100m telescope! I usually move this 17-million-pound telescope from my computer 3,000 miles away! Thrilled I was able to finally see it in person!

Co-I Danna Qasim and I observing remotely during one of the first GLUCOSE sessions. Our cats join in to look at the data! :)

[**IRAM 30m Observations**](https://www.iram-institute.org/EN/30-meter-telescope.php)


Date: 10/7/19 - 10/15/19


Observing at the IRAM 30m telescope in Pico Veleta, Spain!

[**SOFIA Observations**](https://www.sofia.usra.edu/)

Dates: 7/8/22 & 7/9/22

I was able to fly twice on SOFIA to observe my own Cycle 9 project! We used the HAWC+ instrument to get far-IR data and polarization information for prestellar core L63 - a special core that shows strong infall signatures! During the last flight I was able to sit in the cockpit for takeoff and landing! Breathtaking!

Date: 9/28/18 

Observing on SOFIA tonight with polarization instrument HAWC+! We are looking at massive cold gas clumps to study the orientation of the magnetic field to see if it traces the gas outflows, with the goal of learning how massive stars are formed! How cool - a 2.5 telescope on an airplane!

[**MMT Observations**](https://www.mmto.org/)

Date: 2/5/18

Observing at the MMT, a 6.5 meter optical telescope, tonight! We will be looking at a dying star (V Hydrae) which ejects gaseous bullets so fast it would only take them 30min to travel from Earth to the moon!

[**ARO 12m Observations**](http://aro.as.arizona.edu/)

Date: 10/29/17

The first of many nights observing with the 12m on Kitt Peak! We found some complex organic molecules (one of which is the cause of hangovers) in prestellar cores!
