The Teen Astronomy Cafe is an out-of-school program for high school students that provides them the opportunity
to interact with astronomers working on cutting-edge science. Students participate in hands on demonstrations, work
on interative computer activities and listen to presentations from the scientists at NOAO and other institutions.
The students also have the opportunity to ask the speaker and volunteers questions, learning what day in the life 
of an astronomer is all about.
