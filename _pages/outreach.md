[**Astronomy Camp**](https://www.astronomycamp.org/)

Astronomy Camp seeks to motivate all students to further their education in science, math, engineering, 
and technical fields. I was a camper when I was 16 and the 
experience motivated me to continue pursuing astronomy as a career. Now I am a counselor and hope to be that inspiration for the
next generation of scientists and great thinkers!

<!--[**Steward Observatory Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Initiative**](https://sites.google.com/view/sodei)

Steward Observatoryâ€™s Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Initiative, or SO DEI, aims to create a more equitable department by implementing actionable changes through five task forces: admissions, department climate, international scholars, mentoring practices, and recruiting & retention. As a co-organizer, a few of my roles include creating and maintaining the program's website and advertising our work to the larger department community. I am also an active member in the admissions task force.

[**Diversity Journal Club**](https://www.as.arizona.edu/diversity_coffee/)

The Diversity Journal Club is a space created to engage with the Steward Observatory community at all levels on topics of equity,
inclusion, and diversity. As an organizer, I listen to the needs of our community and help lead discussions which will enact
meaningful changes to make Steward Observatory a more welcoming and inclusive community.

Space Drafts (or, Astronomy on Tap TUS) is an astronomy focused public lecture series held every month at The Borderlands Brewing Company in Tucson, Arizona. I gave my talk, "Space Brews: Probing the Origins of Complex Molecules with Radio Telescopes" in April of 2022! Watch it at the link below!

[**Knowledge Village**](https://www.knowledgevillage.org)

I was a speaker for Knowledge Village, an organization that brings experts and professionals into public school classrooms via video chat. I presented a virtual [talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEomu4D-jiQ) about how I got interested in science and what I work on in graduate school to multiple groups of middle school students. 

[**Teen Astronomy Cafe**](http://www.teenastronomycafe.org/)

The NOAO Teen Astronomy Cafe is an out-of-school program for high school students that provides them the opportunity
to interact with astronomers working on cutting-edge science. Students participate in hands on demonstrations, work
on interative computer activities and listen to presentations from the scientists at NOAO and other institutions.
The students also have the opportunity to ask the speaker and volunteers questions, learning what a day in the life 
of an astronomer is all about!
